/** A fire domain that exists only to hand out models.

 * Propagation and flux models are not constructible on their own: their
 * constructors call back into the DataBroker, which calls back into the
 * FireDomain. So a unit test still needs a domain — but only an empty one,
 * with no landscape, no fuel map and no fire. Everything a model reads from
 * the simulation arrives through the `double*` it is handed, which is what
 * makes `getSpeed` and `getValue` testable in isolation.
 *
 * Parameters are process-global: every SimulationParameters method reads and
 * writes SimulationParameters::GetInstance() whatever instance it is called
 * on, so there is no per-domain parameter set to hand out. A test that sets
 * `Iso.speed` or `burningDuration` would therefore change the result of the
 * next one. To stop that, the sandbox snapshots the whole parameter map on
 * construction and restores it on destruction — see ~ModelSandbox.
