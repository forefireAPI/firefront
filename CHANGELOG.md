# Changelog

All notable changes to ForeFire are recorded here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Version numbers are the tags in this repository and the values reported by
`forefire -v`; they are also what `pip install forefire==<version>` resolves.

Entries below v2.5.0 were reconstructed from the release notes and the commit
history, so they summarise each release rather than list every change. The
`Full Changelog` link on each version gives the complete commit range.

## [Unreleased]

Merged since v2.5.0, not yet released.

### Added

- C++ unit tests covering every propagation and flux model, built by default
  and registered with CTest. They exercise the models one call at a time,
  which the `runff` regression test cannot reach. ([#156])
- A dead fuel moisture invariant suite (`tests/python/test_moisture_invariants.py`)
  and the `invariants.yml` workflow that runs it. Unlike `runff` it holds no
  reference data: every assertion follows from the published spread equations,
  so it stays valid across recalibration. ([#158])
- A blocking AddressSanitizer job, and `-DFOREFIRE_SANITIZE=<list>` to build
  with `-fsanitize=<list>` on the compile line, the executables and the shared
  library. ([#180])
- Characterisation tests pinning the HTTP command server's current behaviour.
  ([#174])
- A concurrency stress test for free-threaded CPython
  (`tests/python/test_threading.py`). It does not pass yet: it is the failing
  test for the shared-state work in [#175]. ([#176])
- `-Wall -Wextra` on ForeFire's own sources, with `FOREFIRE_ENABLE_WARNINGS`
  and `FOREFIRE_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS` to control them. NetCDF's headers are
  included as system headers so their warnings do not appear. ([#156])
- `FOREFIRE_BUILD_TESTS` (default on outside wheel builds) to build the unit
  tests. ([#156])
- `TESTING.md` now documents every suite, how to run it, and which ones CI
  validates.
- `pyforefire.ForeFireRunner`, a `ForeFire` that runs in its own worker
  process, so several simulations in one Python process no longer share
  state, and a crash in the kernel raises `pyforefire.WorkerDied` instead of
  ending Python. `ForeFire()` itself is unchanged. ([#175])
- `forefire-validate landscape.nc fuels.csv` checks a landscape against its
  fuel table before a run: fuel indices missing from the table, a fuel and
  elevation shape mismatch, and missing elevation or wind. ([#190])
- `tools/preprocessing/genForeFireCase.py` is back as a general landscape
  writer. Its 3-D and 4-D fields are written in the right axis order, it uses
  `netCDF4` instead of the deprecated `scipy.io.netcdf`, and it checks the
  required `parametersProperties` keys before writing. ([#179])
- A User Guide page on driving a simulation from NumPy arrays, with no
  landscape file and no GIS. ([#189])

### Fixed

- `pyforefire` calls that read the domain (`ff[key]`, `addLayer`,
  `addScalarLayer`, `addIndexLayer`, `getDoubleArray`) segfaulted Python when
  run before `FireDomain[...]`. They now raise `RuntimeError`. ([#202])
- `clear[]` after `loadData` freed the propagative layer twice and crashed.
  The data broker lists that layer but no longer deletes it; the domain does.
  ([#205])
- Rate of spread stayed finite and decreasing at high dead fuel moisture, and
  `DataBroker` no longer serves `moisture` through the five-slot getter, which
  returned a neighbouring property. ([#158])
- The model properties array was freed twice on destruction. ([#157])
- `~ForeFireModel` freed an uninitialised pointer when construction had not
  reached the allocation. ([#156])
- `runANN` had failed on its second line since it was committed: it diffed
  against `result.txt.ref`, a file that is not in the repository. It now checks
  the root mean squared error that `ANN_test` already computes, which does not
  depend on the last digit of a machine-specific reference, and it runs in CI.
  ([#183])
- The `ForeFireAtom` instance counter is now atomic and the `SimulationParameters`
  singleton is initialised safely, so two threads no longer race for ids or
  construct the singleton twice. ([#177])
- `StringRepresentation` kept its output buffer, current level and GeoJSON
  cursor in file-scope globals shared by every instance. They are now members.
  ([#178])
- A fire front reduced to two nodes kept a deleted node as its head, and the
  next burning scan crashed the simulation. ([#198])
- `clear[]` no longer crashes after a simulation whose fire front stopped
  everywhere, for instance an ignition in non-burnable fuel. ([#194])
- `Balbi2020` multiplied by the fuel surface-to-volume ratio instead of
  dividing by it in eq. C7, which drove the radiant fraction to zero. It now
  matches `Balbi2020.py` in `wildfire_ROS_models`, and its rate of spread is
  floored at zero on a downslope with no wind. ([#196])

### Changed

- Linux wheels are built against a NetCDF without DAP and HDF4, roughly halving
  the wheel. ([#154])
- Free-threaded (`cp314t`) wheels are no longer published, because the core is
  not yet thread-safe; CPython 3.14 is declared supported. ([#155])
- `import pyforefire` no longer loads matplotlib; it is imported only when
  `printToPathe` or `plot_simulation` is called. `plt`, `cm`, `mpath`,
  `mpatches` and `ListedColormap` are no longer reachable as `pyforefire`
  attributes. ([#193])
- `listenHTTP[]` binds to `localhost` by default and to the host given in
  `listenHTTP[host:port]`; use `listenHTTP[0.0.0.0:8000]` for the network
  (and inside Docker), which prints a warning.
  `systemExec` is refused over HTTP, the static file server only serves the run
  directory and `FOREFIREHOME/tools/htdocs`, and commands from another site or
  host name are refused. Other commands can still read and write files, so the
  server is meant for trusted local use. ([#199], [#203])
- A safe-topology failure in a step no longer ends the process; the command
  reports an error and the coupled run continues. ([#181])
- `stb_image_write.h` moved to `third_party/`, with its version, origin and
  MIT / public-domain licence recorded. ([#192])

## [v2.5.0] — 2026-08-11

### Added

- **Pip-installable wheels** for Linux (x86_64, aarch64) and macOS on Apple
  Silicon, CPython 3.9 and newer. `pip install forefire` gives both the
  `forefire` command-line interpreter and the `pyforefire` module, with NetCDF
  bundled inside the wheel. Wheels are built without MPI and without
  `-march=native`. There is no Intel macOS wheel — the `macos-13` runner was
  retired before the release, so Intel Macs build from the source
  distribution. ([#151])

### Changed

- The Dockerfile is a multi-stage build, and only `libforefireL` is built in
  the builder stage. ([#147])
- The `install-forefire.sh` build is driven by an option-based `CMakeLists.txt`
  (`FOREFIRE_ENABLE_MPI`, `FOREFIRE_NATIVE_ARCH`, `FOREFIRE_BUILD_PYTHON`,
  `FOREFIRE_STATIC_CORE`, `FOREFIRE_BUILD_TOOLS`, `FOREFIRE_CHECK_LFS`).

### Fixed

- A double free in `FireFront` cleanup. ([#145])
- `CMakeLists.txt` was matched by `.gitignore`, so it was missing from the
  source distribution. ([#152])
- Bugs in `tests/run.bash`, including a `runANN` typo and an unreachable
  `./clean.bash`. ([#146])

  `forefire -l`), serving a map view of the simulation.
- The **Read the Docs documentation site**, built with Sphinx, Breathe and
  Doxygen.
- `install-forefire.sh`, with `-y` to add `forefire` to `PATH` and set
  `FOREFIREHOME`.

- The `RothermelAndrews2018` propagation model. ([#34])

### Changed

- CMake replaces SCons throughout; references to SCons were removed.

### Fixed

- The `-lnetcdf_c++4` link failure. ([#26])
- A division by zero in `setArrivalTime`/`getArrivalTime`. ([#36])

**Full Changelog**: <https://github.com/forefireAPI/forefire/compare/v1.2...v2.0>

## [v1.2] — 2024-01-16

### Added

- The `geojson` dump mode.

## [v1.1.10] — 2022-10-25

### Changed

- CMake became the default build system. ([#9])

## [v1.1.0] — 2022-09-28

Tagged before the sources were moved into `src/`, so that this point in the
repository stays easy to return to.
