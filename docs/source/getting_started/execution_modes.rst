Execution Modes
==================

In the :doc:`quickstart` guide, you launched the example simulation using the interactive Web UI. That is just one of several ways to operate the ``forefire`` interpreter.

This page details all three primary execution modes, allowing you to choose the best method for your specific task:

-   **Direct Execution (Batch Mode):** Best for standard, non-interactive runs or for use in automated scripts.
-   **Interactive Console:** Ideal for experimenting with commands step-by-step or inspecting the simulation state.
-   **Web Interface:** Excellent for visual feedback and interactive demonstrations.

Below, we demonstrate each method using the same ``real_case.ff`` script.

Simulation Files Used
---------------------

The directory ``tests/runff/`` contains the necessary files for the ``real_case.ff`` simulation:

- ``real_case.ff``: The main **script file** defining the simulation steps and commands. This is the file we will execute.
- ``params.ff``: Contains simulation parameters (like model choices, resolutions) included by ``real_case.ff``.
- ``data.nc``: The NetCDF **landscape file** containing geospatial data (elevation, fuel types) for the simulation domain.
- ``fuels.csv``: The **fuels definition file**, specifying properties for different fuel types referenced in ``data.nc``.

The ``real_case.ff`` file itself contains a sequence of ForeFire commands that set up parameters, load data, define an ignition, run the simulation, and save results. To learn about the syntax, structure, and typical commands used within a ``.ff`` script file, please refer to the :doc:`ForeFire Script File guide </user_guide/forefire_script>`.

Executing the Example Script
----------------------------

The following sections demonstrate three different ways to execute the commands contained within the ``real_case.ff`` script using the ``forefire`` interpreter.

1: Direct Execution (Command Line / Batch Mode)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the simplest way to run a simulation non-interactively by feeding the entire script file to the interpreter. It's useful for automated runs.

1.  **Navigate to the test directory:**
  
  Ensure your terminal's current directory is the root of the cloned `forefire` repository. Then navigate:

  .. code-block:: bash

    cd tests/runff

2.  **Execute using the** ``-i`` **flag:**
  
  This tells ForeFire to read and execute all commands sequentially from the specified file (``real_case.ff``).

  If ``forefire`` is in your PATH:

  .. code-block:: bash

    forefire -i real_case.ff

  If ``forefire`` is NOT in your PATH (run from the root of the repo):

  .. code-block:: bash

    ../../bin/forefire -i real_case.ff

3.  **Observe:** ForeFire will create 2 files:

  - ``to_reload.ff``: a Forefire ascii state file ready to be reincluded or modified to run
  - ``ForeFire.0.nc``: a burning map matrix in netcdf

2: Interactive Console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This method starts the ForeFire interpreter first, allowing you to execute the script file using the ``include`` command, and potentially interact further before or after.

1.  **Navigate to the test directory** (if not already there):

  .. code-block:: bash

    cd tests/runff

2.  **Start the ForeFire interpreter:**

  If ``forefire`` is in your PATH:

  .. code-block:: bash

    forefire

  If ``forefire`` is NOT in your PATH (run from the root of the repo):

  .. code-block:: bash

    ../../bin/forefire

3.  **Run the script using the** ``include`` **command:**

  Once you see the ``forefire>`` prompt, type the command to execute the script file.

  .. code-block:: none

    forefire> include[real_case.ff]


4.  **Observe:** The simulation will run similarly to Method 1, executing the commands from ``real_case.ff``. Afterwards, you remain in the interactive console (``forefire>`` prompt) and can inspect parameters (e.g., ``getParameter[propagationModel]``), run further steps manually (e.g., ``step[dt=600]``), or exit using ``quit[]``.

3: Web Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This method, which you may have already used in the :doc:`quickstart` guide, uses the built-in HTTP server to provide a web-based console and map visualization. It executes commands in the same way as the interactive console but through your browser.

1.  **Navigate to the test directory** (if not already there):

  .. code-block:: bash

    cd tests/runff

2.  **Start the ForeFire interpreter and launch the HTTP server:**

  Assuming ``forefire`` is in your PATH:
  
  .. code-block:: bash

    forefire
  
  At the ``forefire>`` prompt, type:

  .. code-block:: none

    forefire> listenHTTP[]

  You should see the output: `>> ForeFire HTTP command server listening at http://localhost:8000`.

  **Alternative Shortcut** using ``-l`` (listen) flag:

  Alternatively, to launch the HTTP server directly without entering the interactive console first, you can use the `-l` command-line option. This is convenient if you primarily want to use the web interface.

  .. code-block:: bash

    forefire -l

  Both bind to ``localhost``. Inside a Docker container, use ``listenHTTP[0.0.0.0:8000]`` instead so the published port reaches the server.

4.  **Use the Web Interface:**

  - Open your browser to ``http://localhost:8000/`` (or the specified port).
  - In the command input box in the web UI, type ``include[real_case.ff]`` and press Enter or click Send. This executes the script file relative to where the interpreter was started (which we ensured was `tests/runff`).
  - Click "Refresh Map" periodically to see the simulation progress visually. You can also type other commands directly into the web console.

Choosing a Method
-----------------

- Use **Method 1 (Direct Execution)** for standard, non-interactive runs or scripting.
- Use **Method 2 (Interactive Console)** when you want to experiment with commands step-by-step or inspect the state directly via text after running a script.
- Use **Method 3 (Web UI)** for visual feedback and interactive demonstrations.
