Things to do
- use of ERA 40 to reanalyse any wildfire using FF/MNH
- include all Firecaster FF models into wildfire ROS library
- generate a fuel file for different water stress
- a nice code generator from python to FF
- numerical unit test for FF in 2D : circles, area round, ellipses, mass conservation for heat fluxes
- numerical tests for fuel models in 2D.. slopes, wind. Best would be 1 model 10 slopes for same wind.
- stuff to make ff from shapefiles
- stuff to make ATmap from fffiles
- stuf to get stats from ATmap
- optimized zip/int lib for tiles.
- fix resolutions for real data.
- generate all tiles for europe using HD fuel data
- get the FWI from mars
- perform a reanalysis on several wildfires in europe, calibrate adjustment speeds with it
- MesoNH Sandbox
